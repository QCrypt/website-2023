      <description>Invited Talk 1: Experimental d evice independent quantum key distribution based on photonic system Speaker: Wen-Zhuo Liu (University of Science and Technology of China)
It is well known that QKD enables information-theoretic secure communication between two distant users. However, its security typically relies on the well-characterized devices operated by legitimate users. In practical scenarios, the imperfect characteristics of devices provide potential attackers with side-channels and back doors In contrast, the device independent QKD protocol - an entanglement - based protocol - provides a scheme for secret key generation without any knowledge of the underlying quantum devices.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Protecting secrets is a key challenge in our contemporary information-based era. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable, for instance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this may have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic, case where the bank‚Äôs security gets compromised. This naturally raises the question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for identifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The unclonability of quantum information has been applied to quantum cryptography. In 1963, Wiesner put forwardthe pioneering idea of quantum money: banknotes encoded as quantum states that cannot be forged simply due toquantum mechanics. His idea was later used in the well-known BB84 quantum key distribution(QKD) protocol.
In this talk, I will present applications of unclonable quantum states beyond information-theoretic constructions suchas Wiesner quantum money and QKD: we use and improve some past tools for quantum money and combine withtechniques from classical cryptography to achieve more applications of computationally unclonable states.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Quantum token schemes are executed in a system of quantum computers, and allow a quantum sender to sample a quantum state which is unclonable to everyone in the system, but also publicly verifiable. Such schemes imply powerful primitives like public-key quantum money, and are at the heart of quantum cryptography. While quantum token schemes allow to realize high-end tasks, their main drawback is that they require a strong computational model to be implemented - quantum computation and a quantum communication infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two remote parties to communicate with information-theoretic security. While QKD has been developed as the most mature technology in quantum communication application, it was still very challenging to practically extend the communication distance of QKD systems beyond the repeaterless limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD protocols overcame this challenge and can beat the fundamental rate-loss limit at high loss regimes. However, experimental implementations of TF QKD have been challenging, due to its requirement of phase stability over very long fiber distances.</description>

      <description>Goal of the conference The Annual conference on quantum cryptography (QCrypt) is a conference for students and researchers working on all aspects of quantum cryptography. This includes theoretical and experimental research on the possibilities and limitations of secure communication and computation with quantum mechanical devices or in the presence of quantum mechanical devices. (The conference includes but is not limited to research on quantum key distribution.)
It is the goal of the conference to represent the previous year‚Äôs best results on quantum cryptography and to support the building of a research community in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>COVID-19 News Quarantine rule Taiwan is on the way to opening its border but certain quarantine rules remain. Currently, the ‚Äú3+4 days‚Äù quarantine rule applies to everyone entering Taiwan:
 For the first three days, you have to stay in a quarantine hotel without leaving the hotel room. In the next four days (now called ‚Äúself-initiated epidemic prevention‚Äù), you can leave the hotel and attend the conference if you show a negative result from a rapid antigen test (valid for two days), but you are not allowed to stay outside the hotel overnight.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography and quantum cryptography seek to offer tools to secure information effectively whenscalable quantum computing is available. Both approaches have unique strengths and limitations in addressingcryptographic needs. This tutorial offers a non-technical introduction to post-quantum cryptography, explainingcommon concepts and techniques in this field and looks at some sample applications, such as secure group-keyestablishment. The talk does not assume familiarity with the research literature in classical cryptography.</description>

      <description>Abstract: A quantum version of the current internet, called a quantum internet, is the holy grail of quantum information processing, ranging from quantum cryptographic protocols to a quantum computer network in a global scale. The indispensable building block is a quantum repeater. In this tutorial, we introduce the current status of our understanding of the quantum internet, as well as why quantum repeaters are necessary to realize it.</description>

      <description>Abstract: On-chip generating, controlling, storing and detecting quantum states of light with integrated photonic circuits provides the way to realizing complex quantum technologies for applications in the fields of quantum computation, simulation and communication. In this talk we present recent progress in large-scale integrated photonic circuit for quantum information processing. We will discuss several silicon-photonic quantum devices that is able to generate, manipulate and analyze various entanglement structures, e.g., multidimensional entanglement, multiphoton entanglement, and topologically protected entanglement.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Security proofs for typical quantum key distribution protocols usually assume the devices used for the protocol operate in a particular way. Verifying that the workings of real world devices satisfy these assumptions and hence that they too exhibit security is a difficult task. However, not doing so means that the implementation is potentially insecure.
Device-independent protocols aim to solve this problem using security proofs that do not rely on the detailed workings of the devices used for the protocol.</description>

      <description>Conference Venue QCrypt 2020 will take at Roeterseiland Campus of the University of Amsterdam, located in walking distance to the inner city center of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
The Roeterseiland Campus is an open city campus designed to offer future-proof teaching and research facilities. The Faculties of Economics and Business and Social and Behavioural Sciences are located at the Roeterseiland campus. The Faculty of Law has settled in August 2017 on the campus.</description>
