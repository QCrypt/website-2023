      <description>Abstract: Mechanical systems have recently attracted significant attention for their potential use in quantum information processing tasks, for example, as compact quantum memories or as transducers between different types of quantum systems. Early experiments included ground-state cooling of the mechanical motion and squeezing of the optical field. Recent advances have allowed to perform measurements which realize various mechanical quantum states.
Here, we would like to discuss experiments where we demonstrate non-classical behavior of mechanical motion by coupling a micro-fabricated acoustic resonator to single optical photons.</description>

      <title>Invited: Discrete-variable quantum key distribution using conjugate homodyne detection (Chair: Thomas van Himbeeck)</title>

      <description>Abstract: Optical homodyne detection has been widely used in continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing for measuring field quadrature. Here we explore the possibility of operating a conjugate homodyne detection system in &amp;ldquo;photon counting&amp;rdquo; mode to implement discrete-variable (DV) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. A conjugate homodyne detection system, which consists of a beam splitter followed by two optical homodyne detectors, can simultaneously measure a pair of conjugate quadratures of the incoming quantum state.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two distant users to establish a common secret string of bits by sending photons across a communication line, often an optical fibre. The photons, however, are scattered by the propagation medium and have only a small probability of reaching the end of the line, which limits the QKD key rate and transmission range. A rigorous theorem limits to 1.44η the number of secure bits delivered by a point-to-point QKD line, with η the channel transmission probability.</description>

      <title>Invited: Practical long distance twin-field quantum key distribution through sending-or-not-sending (Chair: Norbert Lütkenhaus)</title>

      <description>Abstract: The decoy state method makes the secure key rate of practical secure quantum key distribution (QKD) on the linear scale of channel transmittance. The twin-field (TF) QKD, such as the sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol, can have a higher secure key rate on square root scale of channel transmittance. Because of the special structure of SNS protocol, its performance can be largely improved if the error rejection method through two-way classical communication is applied.</description>

      <title>Invited: Quantum Oblivious Transfer from One-way Functions (Chair: Frédéric Dupuis)</title>

      <description>Abstract: The groundbreaking work by Bennett and Brassard on quantum key distribution raised the tantalizing possibility of realizing cryptographic primitives unconditionally with quantum resources. In particular, it opened the possibility of using quantum resources to realize oblivious transfer (OT), a protocol that enables a receiver to obtain exactly one out of two secret bits that a sender owns, without revealing which secret bit is chosen. OT is an important and versatile cryptographic primitive, which in particular enables secure multiparty (quantum) computation (MPC) of any polynomial-time computable function, among many other applications.</description>

      <title>Invited: Security Proofs for QKD Protocols in Infinite Dimensions (Chair: Anthony Leverrier)</title>

      <guid>/sessions/invited_upadhyaya/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: The secure key rate of a QKD protocol can be expressed as a convex minimization over all the states compatible with observed statistics. Recently developed numerical methods allow one to reliably and tightly solve this minimization when the states are finite dimensional. However, when the states are infinite dimensional, it is no longer possible to directly solve the minimization. Fortunately, for many discrete-variable protocols, the problem can be mapped into finite dimensions using squashing models or the flag-state squasher.</description>

      <description>Abstract: In this tutorial I will explain the fundamental principles behind the use of trapdoor claw-free functions to build a qubit certification test, which allows a classical verifier to reach into a quantum computer&amp;rsquo;s Hilbert space, and enforce a qubit structure in it. I will discuss how this leads to protocols for proofs of quantumness, certified randomness and verification of quantum computations. I will also describe refinements of these techniques for improving the efficiency of the protocols.</description>

      <description>Abstract: According to the uncloneability property of quantum information, it is not possible, in general, to duplicate an unknown quantum state. In this tutorial, we survey the area of quantum cryptography through the lens of uncloneability. We start with the early findings on quantum money and quantum key distributions, and then move on to recent work, including uncloneable encryption and uncloneable software. We argue how a better understanding of the foundations of quantum uncloneability could help elucidate some of the most pressing open questions in the area.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The security analysis of a practical QKD has two broad aspects: security of finite-length keys and device modelling. The former studies the trade-off between the producible secret key length, security parameters, and system parameters, while the latter looks at the best possible device models for the actual implementation. In this tutorial, we will introduce the basic concepts of finite-key security and survey some of the recent security analyses for source leakages (Trojan horse attacks, etc).</description>
