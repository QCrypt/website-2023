### System requirements
The QCrypt space is based on EventX. The presentations take place as a Zoom webinar (which can be accessed directly from the QCrypt space), but can also be viewed within the EventX (see below). <a href="https://zoom.us/download" target="_blank">Updating your local Zoom client</a> to the latest version is generally advised. Needless to say that a sufficiently fast and stable internet connection is necessary.
<!--
### Access from China
We asked the meetanyway support about users not being able to connect from China, with the following answer: *Since we are using Google services that might be blocked in China, we recommend using VPN (we recommend <a href="https://cordcloud.biz/" target="_blank">https://cordcloud.biz/</a> ).*
Pre-recorded, invited and tutorial talks, posters, and slides can be downloaded from [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GVXUIIThzcWkd9W).

### The Slack Workspace
The QCrypt Slack workspace enables interaction that is not restricted to the time of the day when the conference is actively running. For instance, participants that were not able to be present at the live presentation and Q&A can this way still ask questions about a presentation. Or, use the Slack private chat to agree on a time and place to meet on the meetanyway platform. Use the link from the email with the participation links to subscribe to the QCrypt 2021 Slack channel.
