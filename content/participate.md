### System requirements
The QCrypt space is based on EventX. The presentations take place as a Zoom webinar (which can be accessed directly from the QCrypt space), but can also be viewed within the EventX (see below). <a href="https://zoom.us/download" target="_blank">Updating your local Zoom client</a> to the latest version is generally advised. Needless to say that a sufficiently fast and stable internet connection is necessary.
<!--
### Access from China
We asked the meetanyway support about users not being able to connect from China, with the following answer: *Since we are using Google services that might be blocked in China, we recommend using VPN (we recommend <a href="https://cordcloud.biz/" target="_blank">https://cordcloud.biz/</a> ).*
Pre-recorded, invited and tutorial talks, posters, and slides can be downloaded from [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GVXUIIThzcWkd9W).

For instance, participants that were not able to be present at the live presentation and Q&A can this way still ask questions about a presentation. Or, use the Slack private chat to agree on a time and place to meet on the meetanyway platform. Use the link from the email with the participation links to subscribe to the QCrypt 2021 Slack channel.
