The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the QCrypt conference; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. For these reasons, the QCrypt organizers are committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience.

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference, at the discretion of the QCrypt Local Chair and/or the QCrypt Steering Committee. If you experience or witness harassment, discriminatory behavior, we encourage you to report this promptly to the members of QCrypt Local committee and/or members of the QCrypt Steering Committee.

Based on the [CRYPTO code of conduct](https://crypto.iacr.org/2018/codeofconduct.html).
