Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography and quantum cryptography seek to offer tools to secure information effectively whenscalable quantum computing is available. Both approaches have unique strengths and limitations in addressingcryptographic needs. This tutorial
offers a non-technical introduction to post-quantum cryptography, explainingcommon concepts and techniques in this field and looks at some sample applications, such as secure group-keyestablishment. The talk does not assume familiarity with the research literature in classical cryptography.
