Abstract: Quantum cryptography promises secure communication between two distant users. However, secure key rate of point-point quantum key distribution (QKD) is bounded by the linear rate-loss limit. Twin-field (TF) QKD can break this limit but its implementation requires global phase tracking and usually also cumbersome interferometric implementations, which are often impractical for network deployment. We remove the above shortcomings with two different solutions. In the first solution, we introduce locally generated frequency combs to stabilise an open channel, and develop a simple and versatile TF-QKD setup that does not need service fibre. In the second, we implement a simple measurement device independent (MDI) QKD with post-measurement pairing technique. We demonstrate the capability of asynchronous MDI-QKD (also named mode-pairing MDI-QKD) overcoming the linear rate-loss limit without global phase tracking.
