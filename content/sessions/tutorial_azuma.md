Abstract: A quantum version of the current internet, called a quantum internet, is the holy grail of quantum information processing, ranging from quantum cryptographic protocols to a quantum computer network in a global scale. The indispensable building block is a quantum repeater. In this tutorial, we introduce the current status of our understanding of the quantum internet, as well as why quantum repeaters are necessary to realize it.
