Imran Khan studied physics in Erlangen, Germany and spent 12 years in the division of Prof. Dr. Gerd Leuchs and the group of Prof. Dr. Christoph Marquardt at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light researching experimental quantum cryptography. He has made numerous contributions to the field, especially by blurring the boundaries between telecommunication technology and continuous-variable quantum key distribution. He has chaired the OPENQKD project and participated in the steering committee of the quantum flagship project CiViQ as well as several other national and EU projects. He co-founded the German Industry Association for Quantum Security (DIVQSec). He is one of the co-founders of the 2020 established company KEEQuant GmbH. In his role as managing director and together with his fellow founders and coworkers, he is driving the vision of industrially scalable quantum cryptography through the photonic integration of CV-QKD.
