Abstract: Photonic quantum memories will play an essential role in many quantum information protocols, particularly for the synchronization of repeater nodes. Most photonic memories operate by storing the photon in matter-based systems, but those approaches have limitations, e.g., they are inherently narrow bandwidth and for only particular wavelengths, often require costly cryogenic overhead, and typically have low retrieval efficiency into single-mode fiber. In this work, we develop a free-space room-temperature photonic quantum memory, allowing us to avoid the aforementioned drawbacks.

Bio: Nathan Arnold is a physics Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked under Professor Paul Kwiat on developing novel quantum memory technologies for various applications in quantum networking.
