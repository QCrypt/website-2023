Norbert LÃ¼tkenhaus is the Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo, and a professor in the Faculty of Science. He also leads the Optical Quantum Communication Theory Group at IQC. He began researching quantum information in 1993, earning his PhD from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, UK. His PhD research built the foundation of the ongoing security analysis of optical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD), leading to the first complete security analysis of practical QKD. His current research is at the intersection between theoretical quantum protocols and practical realizations, and developing quantum optical versions of protocols that realize quantum communication and information complexity advantages.
