Ray Perlner is a member of the Cryptographic Technology Group at NIST, where he has served as a mathematician since 2007. He has been a member of the team organizing the NIST Postquantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process, since its inception in 2016. He has coauthored cryptanalysis papers on several NIST PQC candidates in the multivariate, rank-based, code-based, and hash-based-signature categories, and helped develop the “support minors modeling” technique, which has played a major role in the subsequent cryptanalysis of rank-based and code-based schemes. In addition to his research and standards activity, Ray is a co-author on the third edition of “Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World” (Pearson 2022).
