Abstract: I will give a tutorial on the rapidly developing topic of quantum pseudorandomness, in particular pseudorandom quantum states. These are states that are efficiently generatable, but cannot be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random states. I will discuss their motivation, constructions, and applications to cryptography and beyond.
