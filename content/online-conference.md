## General format
The online edition of QCrypt 2021 will have a similar format as [last year](https://2020.qcrypt.net) that was held online. The authors of accepted papers are asked to prepare and upload a 20-25 minute video of their talks that will be available on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw) several days before the conference.

From Monday, 23 August to Friday, 27 August 2021,

- the main program of the conference (including poster sessions and networking breaks) takes place on the {{< button-link label="meetanyway" url="https://meetanyway.com/events/qcrypt2021/" icon="link" target="_blank">}} platform. Instructions how to access the platform will be sent by email to all registered participants.
- participants can talk to each other on Slack.

All partipants of QCrypt 2021 are bound to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct-online) which in particular states that they have to represent themselves by the full name that they use for their professional work. Violations of the code of conduct should be reported as [indicated here](/code-of-conduct-online).

### Tutorial talks, Invited talks
The tutorial and invited talks are given live on a Zoom webinar, which can be directly accessed from the meetanyway platform, and simultaneously streamed to YouTube. Webinar participants can ask questions via Slack. The speaker will answer the most important questions after the talk on Zoom. After each session, the speaker is moving over to the “Meet the Speakers” tab in the “Presentation area” of [meetanyway](/participate/#meet-the-speakers) and will be available there to answer more individual questions (as it is usually the case at real-life conferences). The tutorial and invited talks are recorded and will be made available on the YouTube channel for offline watching.

### Contributed talks
The [list of accepted papers](/speakers) is here. After making a 20-25 minute video of their talks available before the conference, the live "online" part of presenting contributed articles is divided into thematic sessions. In each session, 3 to 4 contributed articles will be presented by means of a 5 minute talk each, followed by a panel discussion involving the speakers of the session and moderated by some members of the program committee.
After each session, the speakers are moving over to the “Meet the Speakers” tab in the “Presentation area” of [meetanyway](/participate/#meet-the-speakers) and will be available there to answer more individual questions.

### Instructions for authors of accepted papers
Speakers are asked to [register](/registration) to the conference in order to receive all relevant information on accessing the different platforms used during the online conference. As a speaker, you will receive some extra information on top, e.g., you will receive a separate link to access the Zoom webinar as a “panelist”. Generally, it is a good idea to [update](https://zoom.us/download) your local Zoom client to the latest version.

1. We ask the authors of each accepted paper to prepare a 20-25 minute video of their talk by the deadline of **Monday, 16 August 2021**, following <a href="https://iacr.org/videos/guidelines.html" target="_blank">these guidelines</a>.

2. Set the file name of the video to be ‘Talk’ followed by the submission number followed by the last name of the presenting author (e.g. Talk123Smith.mp4).

3. Upload the talk video to [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GVXUIIThzcWkd9W).

4. We will upload your talk to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw) and make it available from our webpage.

Authors of accepted papers will also give a short (5-minute) live presentation during the week of the conference, via a Zoom webinar. For instructions, see below.



### Instructions for Zoom webinar speakers (tutorial, invited, contributed)
Note that all Zoom webinars streamed live to YouTube, and recordings of all talks are available on the QCrypt Conference [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw).

When preparing your slides, leave some room on the upper right corner for the image of yourself on the live stream.

**Mind the time zones! Make sure that you have the right time for your presentation. All times on the schedule are [Amsterdam time (CEST)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html?cities=16,33,165,248,224,176,136&wch=3).**

The protocol for your presentation is as follows:
- Presentations for contributed talks should be 5 minutes.
- In the evening before the day of your session, you receive an invitation as panelist for the Zoom webinar.
- Visit the Zoom webinar 10 minutes before the start of the **session** that features your presentation. During this time, you can then check if screen sharing works, etc.
- Once the webinar is live and the session chair has introduced you and given you the floor, you give your presentation. Ignore chat messages that may pop up during the presentation; the session chair will deal with those.
- All panelists currently not presenting can leave on their cameras, but should mute themselves.
- After all the presentations in a session are finished, the session chair will organize the Q&A.
- When the session with your presentation is over, you are asked to directly go to the "Meet the Speakers" tab in the "Presentation area" of [meetanyway](/participate/#meet-the-speakers).
Participants may now join you in this lounge for further questions and discussions regarding your presentation.
- **After your talk, please upload your slides to [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GVXUIIThzcWkd9W) so we can make them available from our website.** For contributed talks, set the file name of your slides to be ‘QCrypt2021TalkSlides’ followed by the three-digit submission number (suitably padded with leading 0s) followed by the last name of the presenting author (e.g. QCrypt2021TalkSlides012Smith.pdf).

3. Upload the poster to [SurfDrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/GVXUIIThzcWkd9W). Please double-check your file before uploading, because you will not be able to edit it yourself afterwards.

<!-- 4. Posters are now available at {{< button-link icon="link" label="here" url="/accepted-papers/#list-and-download-of-accepted-posters" >}} -->

<!-- 5. During poster session: {{< button-link icon="direction" label="PDF instructions for poster presenters" url="/pdf/QCrypt2021_posterpresenters_instructions.pdf" target="_blank" >}} -->

The protocol for your poster presentation is as follows:
* 5 minutes before the start of the poster session that features your poster, go to the Poster Session area of [meetanyway](/participate/#poster-sessions).
* Look for the tab containing your submission number.
* Make sure your microphone and camera are on.
* You are now ready to receive the participants at your poster.

If you encounter problems, drop by the "Help Desk" in the Main Lobby, send a message to the QCrypt Slack #helpdesk channel, or send an email to {{< button-link label="helpdesk2021@qcrypt.net" url="mailto:helpdesk2021@qcrypt.net" icon="email" >}}.



### Instructions for session chairs
Session chairs are asked to [register](/registration) to the conference in order to receive all relevant information on accessing the different platforms used during the online conference. As a session chair, you will receive some additional information, e.g., you will receive a separate link to access the Zoom webinar as a "panelist". Generally, it is a good idea to [update](https://zoom.us/download) your local Zoom client to the latest version.

**Mind the time zones! Make sure that you have the right time for your presentation.
All times on the schedule are [Amsterdam time (CEST)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html?cities=16,33,165,248,224,176,136&wch=3).**

The protocol for your session chairing is as follows:
* In the evening before the day you chair a session, you receive an invitation as panelist for the Zoom webinar.
* Visit the Zoom webinar 10 minutes before the start of the session you are chairing.
* Check that all upcoming speaker(s) of the session is/are present and ready. If applicable, coordinate the tasks with the other chair, e.g., one chair keeps an eye on the time, the other focuses on questions from the audience.
* All panelists not presenting can leave on their cameras, but should mute themselves.
* Once the webinar is live:
    * Welcome the audience.
    * Quickly explain the procedure, in particular that the audience can ask questions
        * by writing the question into the Slack channel (for sessions with multiple speakers, make sure the question includes the person it is intended for);
        * by raising the hand and being unmuted by the session chair (mostly for tutorial, and possibly invited talks, not used for contributed talks).
    * Introduce the (first) speaker and hand over to him/her for the presentation.
    * In case of a contributed-talks session, once the first speaker is done, give the word to the second speaker, etc.
    * At the end of the session, organize the Q&A:
        * Read out (relevant) questions from the Slack channel.
        * Check for raised hands and unmute temporarily to let the person ask a question. **This requires the chair to be co-host**: as a [security feature](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005474943-Meeting-and-webinar-comparison), regular attendees in Zoom webinars cannot turn on video, and can only speak when activated by a (co-)host.
        * Check if some of the panelists have questions.
        * **If necessary, try to get a bit of a discussion going by asking questions yourself.**
    * Make sure to stay within the allotted time slot.
    * Thank the speaker(s) at the end of the session.
    * Announce that the speaker(s) will be available for further questions in the “Meet the Speakers” tab in the “Presentation area” of [meetanyway](/participate/#meet-the-speakers) (if this is indeed the case).
