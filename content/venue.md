### SAIL Amsterdam
In the week of the QCrypt 2020 conference, there will be a [major sailing event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_Amsterdam) taking place in Amsterdam: <a href="https://www.sail.nl/" target="_blank"> <img src="/images/logos/sail.png" alt="sail logo" height="40"/></a>
During this quinquennial maritime event, various tall ships from all over the world will be on display on the IJ (the river north of Amsterdam Central Station). As the conference restaurant is directly facing the IJ, it promises to be quite a spectacle.
However, it will also be very crowded, so calculate enough time to get there.

### NDSM Wharf
(from https://www.ndsm.nl/en/practical-information/)

Restaurant de IJkantine is located at the NDSM-wharf. From the 1920s until the 1980s, the NDSM-wharf was one of the biggest shipyards in the world, regularly launching huge impressive tankers from its slipways. After this activity ceased, this sprawling location – and its imposing backdrop of crane tracks, sheds and the gigantic slipway – became a home port for creative pioneers.

The colossal shipbuilding shed was transformed into ‘Kunststad’ (‘Art City’), an architectural monument housing some four hundred artists, designers, architects and set designers: one of the biggest artistic incubators in ‘Neerland’, as the locals call Holland.



### Address and Directions
Restaurant De IJkantine, NDSM Kade 5, 1033 PG Amsterdam, The Netherlands

There are several (free) ferries leaving from behind Amsterdam Central train station. When exiting the train station in the direction of the water, take the left-most ferry called NDSM. During peak hours, the ferry departs every quarter, outside every half hour (45 and 15). On Fridays and Saturdays the ferry runs until 03:00. Duration is about 15 minutes. Departures during SAIL might be more frequent.

These are the (walking) instructions from the conference venue to the restaurant:
