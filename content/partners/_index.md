<!-- **Due to the restrictions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, QCrypt 2020 will be held as a fully online event. We will get in touch with our sponsors soon.**

The annual QCrypt conference is the main international event that is dedicated to the latest developments in the field of quantum cryptography. Researchers from all over the world present their recent scientific discoveries in the field and companies display their latest relevant technology. The topic of the conference covers all aspects of *cryptographic security in the presence of quantum devices*, including - but not limited to - quantum key distribution, quantum randomness generation, and the impact of quantum computers on classical cryptography.

The 10th anniversary edition of the conference, QCrypt 2020, will take place in Amsterdam, August 10-14, 2020. The conference is expected to host between 300 and 400 researchers and scientists from the leading international academic research groups and engineers and industry representatives from international companies; all of which are interested in quantum cryptography as a practical technology and in the security of cryptographic schemes under quantum attacks.

We are grateful to our generous sponsors. With their contributions, they not only support this conference series but the field of quantum cryptography in general.
