## COVID-19 News

### Quarantine rule
Taiwan is on the way to opening its border but certain quarantine rules remain. Currently, the “3+4 days” quarantine rule applies to everyone entering Taiwan:<br>

* For the first three days, you have to stay in a quarantine hotel *without* leaving the hotel room.
* In the next four days (now called “self-initiated epidemic prevention”), you can leave the hotel and attend the conference if you show a negative result from a rapid antigen test (valid for two days), but you are not allowed to stay outside the hotel overnight. You will need to wear a mask all time when you are outside the hotel.
* You will receive two rapid test kits at the airport.  We will provide additional rapid test kits at the conference if you need more.
* You have to stay in the same quarantine hotel for the whole 3+4 quarantine period. The day you arrive at the hotel is the 0-th day, so you are expected to book a room for 8 nights.  (See below [link] for information about booking quarantine hotels)

### VISA

The regulation for VISA application is also relaxing and simplifying. Currently, everyone without a Taiwan passport must apply for a VISA to enter Taiwan, and eVisa application is still suspended.

* Currently, the easiest way to get a VISA is to get an invitation letter from us and then apply for a VISA by yourself from a local Taiwan consulate/representative office near your region (please check <a href="https://www.boca.gov.tw/sp-foof-countrylp-01-2.html">here </a> to find one near you).
* As the application procedure may differ in different locations, we suggest that you contact the consulate near you for the up-to-date instruction before the application.
* To get an invitation letter, register online from the QCrypt website. We'll send you an invitation letter after you complete the registration.
* Unfortunately, the VISA application is not open for people holding PRC, HK, and Macau passports yet. We will update the information if the application is open later.

As the regulation is changing over time, if you learn any updates from a local Taiwan consulate, please let us know to help us keep the information up-to-date. Please also do not hesitate to contact us by email{{< button-link label="2022@qcrypt.net" url="mailto:2022@qcrypt.net" icon="email" >}} if you have any questions.

<!--### Visa and entering Taiwan:(updated 6 July. 2022)
In addition to the quarantine requirement, the current border control requires a Visa and a negative PCR test report (with the test carried out in less than 48 hours before one's departure to Taiwan). At the moment, the Visa application is somewhat complicated. We (the local organizers) need to start the application for all QCrypt participants, and it will take a while to go through our Center for Disease Control. Once this is approved, you can collect the Visa from our Consulate Office. Since the paperwork takes a while, we need to collect the required information from you and start the application soon. For the PCR test, you will have to make your own arrangement but we should be able to (at least partially) subsidize the cost incurred.-->
