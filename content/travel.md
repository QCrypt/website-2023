## Transportation

<strong>Three regional airports</strong> serve the greater Washington, D.C. area: Dulles International Airport (IAD); Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA); and Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI). All three are within an hour drive to the campus and local hotels. Detailed driving directions from each airport to the UMD campus are available above.

<strong>Significant construction</strong> is taking place on the UMD campus due to the Purple Line, a new light rail that will extend from New Carrollton in Prince George’s County to Silver Spring and Bethesda in Montgomery County. <strong>Therefore, parking is unavailable for visitors on campus, and pedestrian detours are likely.</strong> The closest parking lot is diagonally across the street from the Iribe Center next to The Hotel, available via <strong><a href="https://www.offcampusparking.com/collegepark">the parking app SpotHero.</a></strong>

Typically, the university is accessible via the College Park/U of MD station on the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/">Washington Metro</a> system's Green Line. <strong>However, parts of the Green Line serving College Park will be closed during QCrypt due to ongoing maintenance</strong>. Buses are provided at closed stations in lieu of the Metro trains, but they are usually overcrowded and inefficient. If you do travel to the College Park/U of MD station by bus, <a href="https://transportation.umd.edu/shuttle-um/104/501">a free UMD shuttle bus #104</a> is available every eight minutes on weekdays between the station and campus.

## Venue
The venue for QCrypt2023 is the <a href="https://iribe.umd.edu/"> Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering</a>, a state-of-the-art building that houses the University of Maryland’s <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)</a>, which is the parent organization of the <a href="https://quics.umd.edu/">Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS)</a>.

<h2>Local Accommodations</h2>
The Conference and Visitor Services for the University of Maryland has partnered with many local hotels to provide competitive rates for UMD visitors. These hotels can individually be accessed <a href="https://campustravel.com/university/university-of-maryland-conference-visitor-services/">here</a>, or go <a href=" https://campustravel.com/university/university-of-maryland-conference-visitor-services/university-of-maryland-conference-visitor-services-search/"> here </a>to compare available rates. 
<h2>VISA</h2>
If needed, the responsibility for obtaining a visa is on the attendee. Attendees from certain countries <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta">may qualify for a visa waiver</a>. However, attendees will still require <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta">Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA)</a> approval prior to travel. A visa letter can be requested upon completion of the registration. 

<h2>Regional Attractions</h2>
The University of Maryland is located approximately 10 miles (16 KM) from Washington, D.C., the nation’s capital. Washington, D.C. is well known for its dramatic neoclassical monuments and buildings on <a href="www.washington.org/visit-dc/monuments-memorials">The National Mall</a>. A gem of the city’s amenities is the <a href="www.si.edu/museums">Smithsonian Institution</a>—the world’s largest complex of museums, galleries and a zoo, which are free to visit.

Located about 30 miles (50 KM) from UMD is <a href="www.visitannapolis.org/">Annapolis,</a> Maryland's capital. This beautiful harbor city is described as a “museum without walls” where centuries of architecture blend with the lively and contemporary.
