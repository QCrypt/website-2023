## Transportation
<strong>Three regional airports</strong> serve the greater Washington D.C. area: Dulles International Airport (IAD); Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA); and Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI). All three airports are within an hour drive to the campus and local hotels. Detailed driving directions from each airport to the UMD campus are available below.

<strong>Significant construction</strong> is taking place due to the Purple Line, a new light rail that will extend from New Carrollton in Prince George’s County to Silver Spring and Bethesda in Montgomery County. Detours—both vehicular and pedestrian—near the Iribe Center are probable. More information is available below.<br>

The closest stop on the Washington Metro is the <strong>College Park/ U of MD Metrorail Station</strong> on the Green and Yellow Lines. A free UMD shuttle bus (#104) is available every eight minutes on weekdays.<br><br>
