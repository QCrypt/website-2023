## Transportation
* Airports 
Three regional airports serve the greater Washington DC area including Dulles International Airport (IAD); Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA); and Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI). There are plenty of flights to Dulles, BWI and Reagan National airports which are all within about an hours drive (without traffic) of the campus and the local area hotels. <br>
Detailed driving directions from each airport to the UMD campus in College Park, as well as regional and local map and information about parking on campus, are available from the <a href="https://cvs.umd.edu/visit/maps-directions"> UMD Conferences and Visitor Services website </a>. Ride-share, shared-van and public options are also available. Metrorail and bus services will require several changes along the way from the airport. 

* Metrorail + Shuttle bus service
The Washington area metrorail service is called the ‘Metro’. The closest station to the UMD campus is the College Park/ U of MD station. This station is on the Green Line. Free (University sponsored) shuttle bus (Shuttle-UM) service is offered between the metro station (pickup located on the east side) and the center of the campus. This is a frequent and year-round service that is open to everyone with no ID requirements.
