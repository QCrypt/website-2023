<h2>Transportation</h2>


<strong>Three regional airports</strong> serve the greater Washington D.C. area: Dulles International Airport (IAD); Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA); and Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI). All three airports are within an hour drive to the campus and local hotels. Detailed driving directions from each airport to the UMD campus are available below.

<strong>Significant construction</strong> is taking place on the UMD campus due to the Purple Line, a new light rail that will extend from New Carrollton in Prince George’s County to Silver Spring and Bethesda in Montgomery County. <strong>Therefore parking is unavailable for visitors on campus, and pedestrian detours are likely.</strong> Parking directly across the street from the Iribe Center is recommended via <strong><a href="https://www.offcampusparking.com/collegepark">the parking app SpotHero.</a></strong>

Typically, the university is accessible via the College Park/U of MD station on the Washington Metro system's green line. <strong>However, this metro line will be closed during QCrypt due to ongoing maintance</strong>. Shuttle busses are provided at stations in lieu of the metro, but they are usually overcrowded and ineffcient. If you do travel to the College Park/U of MD station, a free UMD shuttle bus (#104) is available every eight minutes on weekdays.
