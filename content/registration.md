### Code of Conduct
People who register agree to abide by the <a href="/code-of-conduct">conference code of conduct</a>.


### Why does the registration site only show online option?
Although Taiwan's border quarantine and VISA policy have loosened recently, there remain uncertainties in traveling to Taiwan to attend the conference in person. As such, all participants are considered to be attending online by default. If entry visa is approved, there will be the option to pay for the balance of the registration fee (see below).

### For people who want to participate in person after registering
If you wish to participate in person, please check with the Taiwan Embassy near your region for VISA application process (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.boca.gov.tw/lp-206-2.html">https://www.boca.gov.tw/lp-206-2.html</a>). After your VISA application is approved, please write to us at {{< button-link label="2022@qcrypt.net" url="mailto:2022@qcrypt.net" icon="email" >}} , we will send you a link to pay for the balance of the registration fee.

P.S. If you need an invitation letter for the VISA application, please reply to the registration confirmation letter.

### Student Fee Waiver
Students who seek for a fee waiver should write to the conference organizers at {{< button-link label="2022@qcrypt.net" url="mailto:2022@qcrypt.net" icon="email" >}} with the subject line "QCrypt 2022 Student Fee Waiver" as soon as possible (preferably before July 31st) . If you are a contributed talk presenter, please identify your school, your advisor, and your Paper ID Number in the email. If you are not a presenter, or if you desire more than the registration waiver, please include a short motivating paragraph specifying your school and advisor (if any), and ask your advisor to write us an email in support of your application (one email can pertain to multiple students).

<!-- **You can still register for the conference, but participation links will only be sent out twice a day.** In the meanwhile, you can watch the live stream on our QCrypt Conference YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw/videos
