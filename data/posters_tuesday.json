        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop the resource theory of quantum secret key. Operating under the assumption that entangled states with zero distillable key do not exist, we define the key cost of a quantum state, channel, and device. We study its properties through the lens of a quantity that we call the key of formation. The main result of our paper is that the regularized key of formation equals the key cost of a quantum state. The core protocol underlying this result is privacy dilution, which converts states containing ideal privacy into ones with diluted privacy. Additionally, our main result follows by proving that the key of formation is an entanglement monotone with appealing mathematical properties. We further focus on mixed-state analogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy, and we prove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each other for these states, similar to the case of pure entangled states. The privacy cost and distillable key in the single-shot regime exhibit a yield-cost relation, and basic consequences for quantum channels and devices are also provided.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) based on the fundamental laws of quantum physics can allow the distribution of secure keys between distant users. However, the imperfections in realistic devices may lead to potential security risks, which must be accurately characterized and considered in practical security analysis. High-speed optical modulators, being as one of the core components of practical QKD systems, can be used to prepare the required quantum states. Here, we find that optical modulators based on LiNbO3, including phase modulators and intensity modulators, are vulnerable to photorefractive effect caused by external light injection. By changing the power of external light, eavesdroppers can control the intensities of the prepared states, posing a potential threat to the security of QKD. We have experimentally demonstrated the influence of light injection on LiNbO3-based optical modulators and analyzed the security risks caused by the potential green light injection attack, along with the corresponding countermeasures.",

The derived codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling with high probability equivalent to that of a GKP code obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.",

First, building on (Brakerski et al. 2018, Kalai et al. 2022), we show an optimized two-round proof of quantumness whose security can be expressed directly in terms of the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem.

        "abstract": "Device-independent (DI) protocols have experienced significant progress in recent years, with a series of demonstrations of DI randomness generation or expansion, as well as DI quantum key distribution. However, existing security proofs for those demonstrations rely on a typical assumption in DI cryptography, that the devices do not leak any unwanted information to each other or to an adversary. This assumption may be difficult to perfectly enforce in practice. While there exist other DI security proofs that account for a constrained amount of such leakage, the techniques used are somewhat unsuited for analyzing the recent DI protocol demonstrations. In this work, we address this issue by studying a constrained leakage model suited for this purpose, which should also be relevant for future similar experiments. Our proof structure is compatible with recent proof techniques for flexibly analyzing a wide range of DI protocol implementations. With our approach, we compute some estimates of the effects of leakage on the keyrates of those protocols, hence providing a clearer understanding of the amount of leakage that can be allowed while still obtaining positive keyrates. Our results and techniques should also be relevant in proving security of device-dependent QKD against constrained leakage.",

In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme. Moreover, we show our variant of uncloneable encryption works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money, and can be used to get uncloneable bits without using the quantum random oracle model. Finally, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts.",

We provide an implementation of an encoder for polar codes based on reliability sequence, which is computationally efficient and can be implemented in QKD postprocessing. Our work on improving the efficiency of QKD postprocessing is highly relevant for the commercialization of QKD.",

        "abstract": "Experimental implementations of quantum cryptographic protocols suffer from statistical fluctuations due to finite resources. To suppress the statistical fluctuations, the data size collected is required to be large. However, a large input size heavily penalises the speed and resource consumption of randomness extraction, often forming the bottleneck and limiting the performance of quantum cryptographic protocols. In this work, we propose a sampled sub-block hashing approach to circumvent this problem. We show that using our method, we can achieve higher output speeds on platforms with limited resources, all while still taking into account finite size effects. Our new method could be useful in all quantum cryptographic protocols that satisfy the generalised entropy accumulation framework. As such, our method can be utilised as a general approach for privacy amplification in QKD systems, and randomness extraction in QRNG systems.",

        "title": "Fast and reliable entanglement distribution with quantum repeaters: principles for improving protocols using reinforcement learning",
        "abstract": "Future quantum technologies such as quantum communication, quantum sensing, and distributed quantum computation, will rely on networks of shared entanglement between spatially separated nodes. Distributing entanglement between these nodes, especially over long distances, currently remains a challenge, due to limitations resulting from the fragility of quantum systems, such as photon losses, non-ideal measurements, and quantum memories with short coherence times. In the absence of full-scale fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which can in principle overcome these limitations, we should understand the extent to which we can circumvent these limitations using our noisy quantum resources. In this work, we provide improved protocols/policies for entanglement distribution along a linear chain of nodes, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, that take practical limitations into account. For a wide range of parameters, our policies improve upon previously known policies, such as the ``swap-as-soon-as-possible'' policy, with respect to both the waiting time and the fidelity of the end-to-end entanglement. This improvement is greatest for the most practically relevant cases, namely, for short coherence times, high link losses, and highly asymmetric links. To obtain our results, we model entanglement distribution using a Markov decision process, and then we use the Q-learning reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to discover new policies. These new policies are characterized by dynamic, state-dependent memory cutoffs and collaboration between the nodes. In particular, we quantify this collaboration between the nodes. Our quantifiers tell us how much ``global'' knowledge of the network every node has, specifically, how much knowledge two distant nodes have of each other's states. In addition to the usual figures of merit, these quantifiers add an extra important dimension to the performance analysis and practical implementation of quantum repeaters. Finally, our understanding of the performance of large quantum networks is currently limited by the computational inefficiency of simulating them using RL or other optimization methods. The other main contribution of our work is to address this limitation. We present a method for nesting policies in order to obtain policies for large repeater chains. By nesting our RL-based policies for small repeater chains, we obtain policies for large repeater chains that improve upon the swap-as-soon-as-possible policy, and thus we pave the way for a scalable method for obtaining policies for long-distance entanglement distribution under practical constraints.",

More precisely, we consider a quantum communication architecture where the qubit generation and measurement happen at the two ends of the line, whilst intermediate parties are limited to single-qubit unitary transforms. This network topology has been previously introduced to implement quantum-assisted secret-sharing protocols for classical data, as well as the key establishment, and secure computing.\r\nThis architecture has numerous advantages. The intermediate nodes are only using simplified hardware, which makes them easier to implement. Moreover, key establishment between arbitrary pairs of parties in the network does not require key routing through intermediate nodes. This is in contrast with quantum key distribution networks for which non-\r\nadjacent nodes need intermediate ones to route keys, thereby revealing these keys to intermediate parties and consuming previously established ones to secure the routing process.\r\nOur main result is to show the security of key establishment on quantum line networks. We show the security using the framework of abstract cryptography. This immediately makes the security composable, showing that the keys can be used for encryption or other tasks.",

Compared with existing chip-based QKD works, the scheme can intrinsically compensate for the polarization perturbation to quantum signals and thus work at arbitrary temperatures. We experimentally verify the chips in a time-bin QKD system at the clocking rate of 1.25 GHz and obtain an average secure key rate (SKR) of 1.34 Mbps over a 50 km fiber channel with an optimized analysis model. The steady variations of the quantum bit error and SKR with random polarization disturbance demonstrate that PLC-based AFMIs are available for developing self-stable QKD systems.",

A key requirement of such a promise is to have access to an encryption key with a similar length as the message and data itself.

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables two remote parties to share encryption keys with security based on physical laws. Continuous variable (CV) QKD based on coherent states and coherent detection is a suitable scheme for integration into existing telecom networks. However, thus far, long-distance CV-QKD has only been demonstrated using a highly complex transmitted local oscillator scheme, opening security loopholes for eavesdroppers and limiting its potential applications. Here, we report a long-distance CV-QKD experiment with a locally generated local oscillator over a 100 km fiber channel. This record-breaking distance is enabled by controlling the phase-noise component of excess noise, using a machine-learning framework for carrier recovery and optimizing the modulation variance. We consider the full CV-QKD protocol implementation and demonstrate the generation of keys secure against collective attacks in asymptotic and finite-size regimes. Our results set an essential milestone for CV quantum access networks realization, where a high loss budget is required, and pave the way for large-scale deployment of secure QK.",

        "abstract": "In our work, we provide a clean security analysis of a new high-dimensional QKD setup with a Franson interferometer in the asymptotic limit and calculate secure key rates using a recent method developed. We argue that our new protocol is not only experimentally easier, as it does not require tomography of the polarization degree of freedom, but also allows for a clean security analysis without assumptions that were implicitly hidden in earlier analyses of similar and related protocols. \r\n\r\nWe build a realistic noise model that takes environmental photons, dark counts, channel losses and non-unit detection efficiency into account and show that our new protocol allows secure key rates for twice as many environmental photons than comparable protocols available in literature. We want to highlight that while the security analysis of our protocol is rigorous and clean, the compared key rates for the compared protocol are actually only an upper bound (due to the assumptions implicitly hidden described earlier), so our new protocol outperforms previous settings by at least a factor of 2. \r\n\r\nCurrent free-space QKD implementations are only operable during night when environmental photons are low, but fail to provide secure keys during twilight and daytime, which is a major obstacle towards broad practical usage. Thus, doubling the robustness against environmental photons marks an important step forwards towards daylight-independent Quantum Key Distribution implementations.",

        "abstract": "Nonlocal tests on multipartite quantum correlations can certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate witness, known as a Bell inequality, difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, however achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which are often incompatible with optimal randomness generation. As a result we find a trade-off between maximum randomness and Bell violation. Understanding this trade-off for more than two parties has not been explored, and would inform the best way to generate DI randomness in this setting. Moreover, suitable techniques that enable maximum randomness certification for arbitrarily many parties are missing. Here, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations exhibiting a violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. We find that maximum quantum violation and maximum randomness are incompatible for any even number of parties, with incompatibility diminishing as the number of parties grow, and conjecture the precise trade-off. We also show that maximum MABK violation is not necessary for maximum randomness for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a new technique for randomness certification, which we call \"expanding Bell inequalities\". Our technique allows one to take a bipartite Bell expression, known as the seed, and transform it into a multipartite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.",

The primary objective of the station is to enable quantum key distribution and  facilitate other free space communication protocols. The development of the optical ground station is underway and it is projected to be commissioned by 2023.  \r\nWe elaborate on the building blocks and design techniques of the optical ground station in Singapore that can receive i.e downlink weak quantum signals from a satellite and perform necessary analysis to generate secret keys in a quantum key distribution experiment. We emphasize on the  different subsystems namely the telescope system, quantum receiver, polarization correction system, and the pointing, acquisition and tracking system. We envision our ground station to support a range of beacon wavelengths to ensure its compatibility with various similar satellite missions. The working lab-configuration of the station is able to receive and analyse state of photons around 800 nm. \r\nTo achieve a global quantum network, cross-compatibility among optical ground stations and quantum satellites  is crucial. To facilitate this, we have initiated a collaboration with various academic groups involved in satellite based quantum key distribution research to standardize the configuration of an optical ground station. This collaboration aspires to create cross-compatibility among multiple optical ground stations and quantum satellites to enhance the efforts of a global quantum network.",

        "abstract": "In the context of telecommunications-wavelength fiberoptic resources, quantum-classical coexistence is considered an economical approach for efficient quantum networking, such as through (dense) wavelength-division multiplexing. However, inadequate filter isolation can introduce unwanted crosstalk noise. In this study, we investigate polarization-entangled photons contaminated by highly polarized classical signals, mapping them to maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). Notably, MEMS can be effectively concentrated using a local filtering technique commonly referred to as the Procrustean method. To achieve this, we employ programmable polarization-dependent loss emulators (PDLEs), resulting in significant enhancements in the measured state fidelities.",

        "abstract": "As our lives and interactions become more dependent on the internet, our security needs continue to evolve. Future transactions will likely be secured by quantum means such as point-to-point quantum key distribution and more complex quantum protocols. Quantum key distribution has the potential to revolutionize secure communication, but it is often limited by device imperfections and environmental factors such as weather conditions. Currently, quantum key distribution schemes based on orbital angular momentum-carrying optical beams employ conventional settings. As a result, various attacks, such as detector side-channel attacks, are possible, and these beams are subject to spatial aberrations because of atmospheric turbulence and poor weather conditions. As a result, we present a novel approach to measurement device-independent quantum key distribution scheme using vortex vector modes and scalar beams that is capable of achieving high key rates even under diverse weather conditions, including clear skies, light rain, and fog. Furthermore, adopting this approach maximizes the advantages of both orbital angular momentum states and measurement device-independent quantum key distribution. According to our implementation, a secure key can be transmitted up to a maximum distance of approximately 178 kilometers under clear conditions, and we can transmit signals up to a comparable distance of approximately 160 kilometers under adverse weather conditions. Since these distances are comparable, this work presents a significant advance, illustrating how measurement device-independent quantum key distribution can be implemented using vortex vector modes. Most significantly, results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, opening up new possibilities for secure long-distance communication under adverse weather conditions.",

To realize high-speed, real-time communication of large-volume data using one-time pad cryptography with QKD modules, it will be important to multiplex QKD modules in the future. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the physical size of the device for the practical application of multiplexed QKD modules.\r\nIn this study, we focused on miniaturizing the key distillation process required at the back end of the QKD chip. To reduce the size of the device, it is necessary to estimate as accurately as possible the minimum computing power required to run the key distillation process for the target secret key rate (SKR). However, the performance of the key distillation process requires computing power and involves the exchange of messages via classical channels. \r\nTherefore, we evaluate the performance by a network simulator before performing evaluations on the actual equipment.\r\nIn this paper, we focus on the behavior of classical communication paths in the multiplexed QKD system, which is a problem in studying the key distillation process, and we evaluate it with the simulator. Specifically, we clarify the relationship between the required performance of the key distillation process (i.e., throughput) and the target SKR, which is necessary to realize a part of the key distillation process in hardware.",

Our proof methods may also have numerous applications in other areas of QKD and quantum cryptographic research.  Finally we evaluate our new bound and show that positive key-rates are possible even in noisy scenarios.  Since early quantum repeaters are bound to be noisy, yet also bound to be partially trustworthy in some scenarios, our work shows improved bit generation rates are possible for early QKD networks.",

For prepare-and-measure QKD, one recently developed approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy accumulation theorem (GEAT), but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, incorporating several methods to optimize the min-tradeoff function and minimize the second-order term in the GEAT. As a particular focus, we analyze decoy-state protocols and present a method for generically obtaining min-tradeoff functions for such protocols, even those where a closed-form expression for the asymptotic rate is not known. Furthermore, we highlight that the techniques we develop in the process should also yield improved bounds on the keyrates of decoy-state protocols even in the asymptotic limit.",

        "abstract": "Dense coding is known as an attractive quantum information protocol.\r\nWhile the original study considers the noiseless setting, many subsequent studies extended this result to more general settings. However, all of them focused only on the communication speed in  various noisy settings. While dense coding with the noiseless setting realizes twice communication speed, it also realizes quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) as follows.In dense coding, the sender, Alice, and the receiver, Bob, share perfect Bell states and Alice encodes her message by application of a unitary operation. Since Alice's local state is a completely mixed state, the eavesdropper, Eve, cannot obtain any information about the message even when Eve intercepts the transmitted quantum state. However, it is not easy to share a perfect Bell state. Hence, we need to consider secure communication under imperfect shared state. Specifically, we study secure direct communication by using a general preshared quantum state and a generalization of dense coding. In this scenario, Alice is allowed to apply a unitary operation on the preshared state to encode her message, and the set of allowed unitary operations forms a group. To decode the message, Bob is allowed to apply a measurement across his own system and the system he receives. In the worst scenario, we guarantee that Eve obtains no information for the message even when Eve access the joint system between the system that she intercepts and her original system of the preshared state.\r\n\r\nFor a practical application, we construct a modular wiretap code by concatenating inverse universal hashing and an arbitrary error correcting code.  Combining the wiretap code with error verification, we propose a concrete protocol for the private dense coding model and derive an upper bound of information leakage in the finite-length setting. We also discuss how to apply our scenario to the case with discrete Weyl-Heisenberg representation when the preshared state is unknown.  In this case, Pauli encoding operation and Pauli channel are considered. Hence, our protocol can be applied many similar tasks.",

        "abstract": "The reliability of quantum resources can be compromised in practice due to the complexity of their generation processes and/or the potential manipulations by untrusted parties during transmission. When performing an information task with an unreliable quantum resource, it is incorrect to treat the random variables associated with repeated experimental trials as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).  To certify the performance of such a task, one can make a random decision in each trial, either to spot-check some property of the quantum resource or to utilize the resource for the task. The task considered can be quantum key distribution, quantum randomness expansion, verifiable quantum computation, or resource allocation in quantum networks. Unfortunately, existing methods for certifying quantum performance through spot-checking are not suitable for non-i.i.d. repeated trials without additional assumptions. Here we present a novel method to address this challenge. The method works efficiently with a finite number of non-i.i.d. trials. Furthermore, our method can be adapted to estimate quantum properties in situations where the quantum resource is spot-checked and destroyed by a measurement during each non-i.i.d. repeated trial.",

        "title": "FPGA-Based LED Source with Indistinguishable States for Decoy State QKD",
        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems provide a method for two users to exchange a provably secure key that can be used to establish an unconditionally secure communication channel. Here we present an FPGA-controlled prepare-and-measure BB84 polarization-based decoy state protocol using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Our setup uses three separate LEDs driven by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that go through different optical paths that set the state of polarization. Each LED is connected to two GPIO pins via a different resistive path. By setting one pin to high impedance and driving the other with a nanosecond-scale electrical signal, we can choose between signal and decoy states. We can thus send 3 signal states, 3 decoy states, and 3 vacuum states. To prevent side-channel attacks multi-source QKD systems require that each state is indistinguishable from the others in the spatial, spectral, and temporal degrees-of-freedom on the photon. We do this by passing the 3 photonic wavepackets through the same single-mode fiber and 1-nm-bandwith spectral filter and use dynamic shifting of the FPGA phase-locked-loops to control the phase and the width of the electrical pulses that drive the LEDs, which allows us to control the optical pulses produced by the LEDs. Both spectral and temporal profiles are shown in Figure 1. We control the timing of the photonic wavepackets to a resolution of 78 ps. Additionally, we use the FPGA to generate true random states as required by the BB84 protocol. To quantify the indistinguishability of Alice\u2019s various states, we use the mutual information to calculate the fraction of the final sifted key that an eavesdropper would know after making temporal and/or spectral measurements on every state that is sent. We are able to achieve 2.39e-05  and 4.31e-05 mutual information fraction leaked in the spectral and temporal waveforms, respectively. Furthermore we put our scheme into practice with a simple tabletop QKD setup where we are able to achieve 1.7% quantum bit-error rate (QBER) in the L/R bases and 2.1% QBER in the H/V bases. Additionally, our system's SWaP restrictions make it very desirable for highly mobile platforms such as drones.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a method for two users to exchange a provably secure key, which requires synchronizing the user\u2019s clocks.  Qubit-based synchronization protocols directly use the transmitted quantum states and thus avoid the need for additional classical synchronization hardware, but previous approaches sacrifice secure key either directly or indirectly.  Here, we introduce a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm that incorporates all published information to efficiently find the clock offset without sacrificing any secure key [1].  Additionally, the output of the algorithm is a probability, which allows us to quantify our confidence in the synchronization.  \r\nOur experimental system employs an efficient three-state BB84 prepare-and-measure protocol with decoy states.  Our algorithm exploits the correlations between Alice\u2019s published basis and mean photon number choices (which must already be published for the protocol) and Bob\u2019s measurement outcomes to probabilistically determine the most likely clock offset.  We perform cross-correlations using Fast Fourier Transforms to count the number of each type of event pairing for each potential offset (e.g., how many times Alice sent a decoy state in the horizontal/vertical polarization basis and Bob registered a click in the horizontal detector).  Taking these along with a lookup table for the probabilities of the different event pairings, we determine the synchronization probability of the different potential offsets using Bayesian analysis.\r\nTo demonstrate the robust nature of this algorithm, we tracked its performance using simulated data with varying parameters.  We find that we can achieve a 95% synchronization confidence using a string length of only 4,140 communication bin widths, meaning we can tolerate clock drift approaching 1 part in 4,140 in this example when simulating this system with a dark count probability per communication bin width of 8\u2a0910-4 and a received mean photon number of 0.01.  The relationship between the received mean photon number and the number of communication bin widths required to achieve a 95% synchronization confidence is shown in Fig. 1.\r\nWe applied this algorithm to data collected from our drone-to-done QKD experiments, with a received mean photon number of 0.043, achieving quantum bit error rates of 0.0106, 0.0287, and 0.0361 for our 3 states.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution offers unconditionally secure keys for communicating parties. Although using high-dimensional quantum systems in QKD protocols does offer considerable advantages, which has been extensively shown in different experiments, analytical security proofs for high-dimensional protocols are not abundant. This is partly because many QKD protocols lack certain ``symmetry'' in terms of the parties' capabilities and responsibilities, which complicates security proofs. In this work, we consider one such protocol and provide analytical security proof and compare our results against prior work showing an advantage of our method. We also develop a continuity bound for conditional quantum entropies which is pertinent to our analysis here and may have applications in other scenarios also.",

We extend this analysis to decoy-state protocols, which are essential for long-distance QKD.

        "abstract": "Quantum information technologies that utilize entangled photon pairs assume a single- \r\nphoton source. While this assumption poses no significant issues when the channel loss is \r\nlow, high loss can have a detrimental impact on the system's performance. To overcome \r\nhigh loss, the most intuitive solution is to increase the gain of entangled photon pairs by \r\nsending a large quantity of them. However, high-gain sources tend to degrade the \r\nquantum quality of entangled photon pair sources. We derived the density matrix of the \r\nquantum state in the distribution of polarization-entangled photon pairs under the non- \r\nsymmetric channel losses with threshold detectors. We analyzed the variation of the CHSH \r\ninequality parameter  S and the effective photon state transfer probability  \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a by changing \r\nthe non-linear gain  \u03b3. The increase and subsequent decrease in Nm with increasing \u03b3 can \r\nbe interpreted as follows: when \u03b3 is small, the state is not properly transmitted due to high \r\nloss, but as \u03b3 increases, the error probability, such as double-click events, increases due to \r\nthe influence of multi-photon events, leading to a decrease in Nm. This result indicates the \r\nneed to optimize the brightness of the light source for practical implementation in \r\nquantum information technologies. This study is expected to contribute to the analysis of \r\ndiscrete variable quantum key distribution(DVQKD) systems like BBM92, E91, and long- \r\ndistance quantum imaging systems in the future.",

However, the non-IID structure of COW due to its inter-signal coherence makes standard security analysis inapplicable. Recently, it has been shown that a modified COW setup allows standard IID analysis, but at the cost of imposing extra limitations and increasing the number of pulses required for each bit. Here we propose a variant that possesses the IID structure and completely retains the optical setup of COW, but with a different data processing scheme that ignores inter-signal information. We obtain key rate lower bound close to analysis for the previously proposed IID variant, and achieves a higher number of key bits transmitted per second.",

        "abstract": "Two new concepts of quantum random number generators (QRNG) are presented. The first one is related with the application of quantum entanglement to producing several mutually coupled in a random manner bit sequences, which can be used in cryptographic applications and verified in a parallel manner allowing for entropy measurement in real time in public domain using arbitrary large resources for patterns detection, but without compromising the secrecy of coupled by quantum entanglement dual random binary sequences. This is a new concept for verification of fidelity of random bit sequences in a fully non-destructive way, allowing for various applications of generated random bits for which secrecy is important (e.g. in cryptograhic applications). The idea is the development of former our proposal [1]. The second concept is reletad to our progress in prototyping of miniaturized QRNG utilizing the quantum transitions allong the Fermi golden rule as the entropy source, developed for application to quantum cryptography (QKD) systems based on continuous variables. The prototype exploiting, as the source of the entropy, the photoelectric process in a photodiode coupled to a small LED is miniaturized to size of 2 cm [2] and produces the random sequence with a rate of 1 Mb/s. We present current developments of the concept towards its further miniaturization to sizes suitable for using this QRNG device in portable computers, mobile phones and miniaturized terminals for QKD using non-entangled photons. \r\n\r\n1.\tJanusz E.

        "title": "The Quantum Chernoff Divergence in Advantage Distillation for QKD and DIQKD",
        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) aims to extract secret keys from correlations between quantum systems. Most QKD research focuses on \"device-dependent\" protocols whose security is conditioned on their quantum devices operating within specified tolerances. These assumptions on device operation render device-dependent protocols vulnerable to attacks that exploit the differences in real devices and their models in security proofs, and hence threaten the security of such protocols. Alternatively, Device-independent (DI) QKD seeks to achieve security with minimal assumptions on quantum devices by relying on quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities, overcoming this short-coming of device-dependent QKD. \r\n\r\nOur work is motivated by the following two observations. First, DIQKD is more secure but has worse noise and loss tolerances than device-dependent QKD. This point has motivated investigations into new techniques to improve these tolerance thresholds such as random key generation, random post-selection, noisy pre-processing and advantage distillation, the last of which we investigate, and which describes a two-way communication procedure in the error correction step of the protocol. Second, the precise circumstances in which DIQKD is possible are unclear, since not all correlations that violate Bell inequalities can be used to distill a secret key in DIQKD. Under the independent and identically distributed (IID) collective attacks framework, previous work sought to resolve both problems by implementing DIQKD with an advantage distillation protocol called the repetition-code protocol. The authors derived both a sufficient and a conjectured necessary condition for security based on the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, the significance of their results was limited by a gap between the two security conditions, which prevented the calculation of tight noise tolerance bounds and suggested that the fidelity is not the right quantity to consider to characterize exactly when key distillation in DIQKD is possible. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in our work we replace the fidelity in the security proofs with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a measure of distinguishability in symmetric hypothesis testing, and achieve equivalent sufficient and necessary conditions for security for the repetition-code DIQKD protocol under the i.i.d collective attacks framework. Consequently, our work strongly indicates that quantum Chernoff divergence is the relevant quantity to describe the security of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol. With our new security condition, we show that the noise tolerance thresholds of the repetition-code DIQKD protocol outperform even one-way DIQKD protocols implemented with noisy pre-processing and random key measurements.",

        "title": "Quantum key distribution with multiple photon number distributions",
        "abstract": "High brightness, low-g2 single-photon sources (SPSs) are an alternative to commonly employed weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources for discrete variable quantum key distribution (QKD) and offer potential key-rate and finite-block scaling advantages. However, the loss tolerance of SPS-based QKD is compromised by photon number splitting (PNS) attacks against non-negligible multiphoton emissions. Decoy state (DS) techniques mitigate against PNS attacks, with WCP-DS QKD over several hundred km in fibre being demonstrated. Here, we adapt the DS method to any practical SPS that can easily generate multiple photon number distributions (PND) by attenuating its original photon emissions. Hence, we provide finite-key security bounds for a Multi-PND (adapted 2-Decoy) protocol using Efficient BB84 with optimised parameters. We use a particular true quantum dot source to compare its key rate generation with a Single-PND (adapted Non-Decoy) protocol for several finite block sizes. As expected, the Multi-PND gives higher key rates than the Single-PND, except for considerably small blocks. Moreover, the Multi-PND protocol goes beyond 200 km of tolerable fibre distance for high acquisition times. In this work, we set a generalised method to employ the DS techniques with any realistic SPS and further research may be done implementing distinct SPS characteristics.",
